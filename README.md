# DSA in Java – Topic-wise Practice Repository

This repository contains my structured Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice in **Java**, organized by topics commonly asked in technical interviews (MAANG + product-based companies).

Each topic folder (e.g., `arrays`, `linked_list`, `trees`) contains subfolders for individual problems, and each problem includes:

- `Problem.txt`: The problem statement or summary
- `Solution.java`: My Java implementation of the solution

## How to Use

- Navigate to any topic folder (e.g., `arrays/`, `linked_list/`)
- Open any problem subfolder
- Read the `problem.txt` to understand the question
- Refer to `solution.java` to see my Java implementation
